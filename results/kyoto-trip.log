[Agent] Reasoning and sources
- I searched for authoritative, up-to-date guidance and opened the Kyoto City official travel site and the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) Kyoto page to extract must-see cultural and food-related sights and experiences. Sources used:
  - Kyoto City Official Guide (Kyoto Travel) — https://kyoto.travel/en/ (loaded and analyzed)
  - Japan National Tourism Organization — Kyoto page — https://www.japan.travel/en/destinations/kansai/kyoto/ (loaded and analyzed)

Result — curated list of must-see sights, museums and cultural / food experiences in Kyoto
(organized for someone whose priorities are culture + food; short note and source(s) for each item)

1) Iconic temples & shrines (must-visits)

  - https://kyoto.travel/en/
  - https://www.japan.travel/en/destinations/kansai/kyoto/
- Etiquette highlights: respect geiko/maiko privacy (don’t follow/stop them for photos), don’t eat while walking in markets (eat at stalls), use designated smoking areas (street smoking is restricted in many central areas), and carry a small bag for trash when no bins are available. [Kyoto Travel guidance]
  - https://kyoto.travel/en/
- Reservations: for kaiseki dinners, special tea ceremonies, and popular museums or maiko experiences, book in advance (especially in high season). [Kyoto Travel]
  - https://kyoto.travel/en/

Suggested short "culture + food" day ideas (examples pulled from official guidance)
- Early morning: Fushimi Inari Taisha (before the crowds) → late breakfast at Nishiki Market (food crawl) → afternoon Kiyomizu‑dera + historic lanes → evening kaiseki dinner or Pontocho dining. [Kyoto Travel; JNTO]
  - https://kyoto.travel/en/
  - https://www.japan.travel/en/destinations/kansai/kyoto/
- Arashiyama day: morning bamboo grove & Tenryu‑ji garden → riverside lunch (yudofu or riverside restaurants) → visit local temples and finish with an onsen/relaxation (outside city center). [Kyoto Travel]
  - https://kyoto.travel/en/

If you want, next steps I can take (not executed in this step)
- Compile a compact one‑day and two‑day culture+food Kyoto itinerary with times and reservation recommendations.
- Pull museum opening hours, address and nearest station for the specific sites you want to visit.
- Find recommended tea‑ceremony and kaiseki booking options (with contact links).

[Agent] Tool use: This step did not require external lookups — itinerary built from previously gathered attraction/food lists (Kyoto Travel, JNTO, Japan Guide, MICHELIN). Reasoning: balance mornings for popular outdoor temples (avoid crowds), midday for markets/food, afternoons for museums/walks, evenings for kaiseki/maiko/izakaya; include at least one hands‑on cultural workshop and a day trip for Uji/Fushimi sake.

General timing & transport guidance
- Start early (07:00–08:30) for outdoor/high‑demand sites (Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama bamboo grove, Kinkaku‑ji). Afternoon museum visits avoid the morning rush. Evening meals are best reserved for popular kaiseki and maiko shows.
- Typical transfer times inside Kyoto: 15–40 minutes by subway/train/taxi between major districts; buses connect many temple areas but can be slow in peak traffic. Use subway/rail for faster travel across the city.
- Reservations required/recommended: kaiseki ryōtei (Kikunoi, Hyotei, Kitcho), tea‑ceremony workshops, kimono dressing, brewery tours and maiko performances. For casual street/market meals no reservation needed.
- Crowd & etiquette tips: avoid weekends/holiday peak for popular spots if possible; be respectful in geisha districts (do not follow or pressure photographers); don’t eat while walking at some sacred streets — eat at stalls or designated spots. (Sources: Kyoto Travel, Japan Guide)

Optional swaps & variations
- If you prefer fewer high‑end meals, replace one kaiseki dinner with an extended market/izakaya crawl in Pontocho or Nishiki.
- If staying fewer nights, combine Day 3 & Day 5 activities (Northern temples + workshop + museum) into one long day — expect a full, active schedule.
- If interested in onsen: schedule on Arashiyama day or near departure for relaxation.

[Agent] Purpose and approach
This research identified the cultural highlights, food experiences, and practical dining options in Kyoto, then used those findings to build a balanced 5‑day itinerary that mixes sightseeing, hands‑on cultural activities, and meals. I examined iconic temples, traditional districts, museums, markets, recommended restaurants (from mainstream guides and curated selections), and organized everything for efficient timing and a strong cultural + culinary experience.

Key findings (integrated)
- Core cultural must-sees: Fushimi Inari Taisha (thousands of torii), Kiyomizu‑dera with the historic Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka lanes, Kinkaku‑ji (Golden Pavilion), Ginkaku‑ji (Philosopher’s Path), Tenryu‑ji and the Arashiyama bamboo grove, and principal museums such as Kyoto National Museum and Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art. These sites form the backbone of a culture‑focused visit and are best scheduled early to avoid crowds.
- Traditional districts for atmosphere and photography: Gion (Hanamachi), Pontocho alley, Higashiyama streets — great for evening walks, geisha/maiko spotting (with respectful behavior), and atmospheric dining.
- Food hubs and specialties: Nishiki Market is the top market for sampling local specialties (yuba, pickles, dashimaki, grilled snacks). Uji is the destination for premium matcha and tea‑ceremony experiences; Fushimi is the sake district for brewery visits and tastings. Kyoto’s signature cuisines include kaiseki (formal multi‑course), tofu/yudofu, shojin‑ryori (temple vegetarian), and local sweets (kyo‑gashi).
- Dining options and recommendations: For an authentic mix, combine market stalls and casual izakaya with at least one high‑end kaiseki dinner (notable names include Kikunoi, Hyotei, Kitcho — these require advance reservations). Michelin and Bib Gourmand lists highlight both top haute cuisine and excellent value spots (ramen, yakitori, soba).
- Practical patterns: Start popular outdoor sites early (07:00–09:00); reserve evenings for kaiseki or maiko performances; use trains/subways for faster cross‑city travel and buses for direct temple access; book workshops (tea ceremony, kimono dressing, brewery tours) in advance. Respect local etiquette in geisha districts and food markets (no chasing/pressuring performers; avoid eating while walking in certain areas).

5‑day itinerary overview (high‑level)
Day 1 — Higashiyama & Nishiki Market
- Morning market crawl (Nishiki) → Kiyomizu‑dera and Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka → Gion stroll → dinner in Pontocho. Good intro to Kyoto’s streets, sweets and early kaiseki/izakaya.

Day 2 — Arashiyama & Sagano
- Early bamboo grove visit → Tenryu‑ji garden → yudofu lunch → optional scenic train/boat → riverside dinner or station‑area izakaya. A nature‑temple day with tofu specialties.

Day 3 — Northern temples & Philosopher’s Path
- Kinkaku‑ji → Ryoan‑ji → Philosopher’s Path to Ginkaku‑ji → afternoon tea/tea‑ceremony → evening kaiseki or cultural performance. Focus on gardens, contemplative walks, and matcha.

Day 4 — Fushimi (sake) and Uji (tea)
- Early Fushimi Inari → Fushimi brewery tours & tastings → train to Uji for Byodoin and matcha tastings → relaxed evening meal back in Kyoto. Dedicated sake + tea day trip.

Day 5 — Hands‑on culture, museums, and farewell dining
- Morning workshop (kimono dressing, ikebana, or calligraphy) → museum visit (Kyoto National Museum or Manga Museum) → Nishijin textiles or last shopping → special farewell dinner (another kaiseki or izakaya crawl). Wind down with cultural immersion and souvenir shopping.

Top practical tips (concise)
- Timing: beat crowds at Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama bamboo grove and Kiyomizu by going early; reserve kaiseki and workshops well ahead.
- Reservations: required for high‑end ryōtei and recommended for tea ceremonies, kimono sessions, and some brewery tours.
- Etiquette: respect geiko/maiko privacy; follow stall rules at markets; carry small bags for trash—public bins are limited.
- Transport: use trains/subways between districts; buses are useful for temple clusters but can be slower in traffic.

Conclusions
Kyoto offers a compact, richly layered cultural experience that pairs naturally with distinctive regional cuisine. Structure your days so mornings tackle the busiest outdoor temples, midday is for market and specialty food sampling, afternoons for museums or relaxed walks, and evenings for reserved kaiseki or lively izakaya dining. Reserve key cultural workshops and high‑end dinners in advance, and plan at least one day each for Arashiyama and the Fushimi/Uji pair to experience Kyoto’s nature, sake, and tea traditions.

Purpose and approach
This research identified the cultural highlights, food experiences, and practical dining options in Kyoto, then used those findings to build a balanced 5‑day itinerary that mixes sightseeing, hands‑on cultural activities, and meals. I examined iconic temples, traditional districts, museums, markets, recommended restaurants (from mainstream guides and curated selections), and organized everything for efficient timing and a strong cultural + culinary experience.

Key findings (integrated)
- Core cultural must-sees: Fushimi Inari Taisha (thousands of torii), Kiyomizu‑dera with the historic Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka lanes, Kinkaku‑ji (Golden Pavilion), Ginkaku‑ji (Philosopher’s Path), Tenryu‑ji and the Arashiyama bamboo grove, and principal museums such as Kyoto National Museum and Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art. These sites form the backbone of a culture‑focused visit and are best scheduled early to avoid crowds.
- Traditional districts for atmosphere and photography: Gion (Hanamachi), Pontocho alley, Higashiyama streets — great for evening walks, geisha/maiko spotting (with respectful behavior), and atmospheric dining.
- Food hubs and specialties: Nishiki Market is the top market for sampling local specialties (yuba, pickles, dashimaki, grilled snacks). Uji is the destination for premium matcha and tea‑ceremony experiences; Fushimi is the sake district for brewery visits and tastings. Kyoto’s signature cuisines include kaiseki (formal multi‑course), tofu/yudofu, shojin‑ryori (temple vegetarian), and local sweets (kyo‑gashi).
- Dining options and recommendations: For an authentic mix, combine market stalls and casual izakaya with at least one high‑end kaiseki dinner (notable names include Kikunoi, Hyotei, Kitcho — these require advance reservations). Michelin and Bib Gourmand lists highlight both top haute cuisine and excellent value spots (ramen, yakitori, soba).
- Practical patterns: Start popular outdoor sites early (07:00–09:00); reserve evenings for kaiseki or maiko performances; use trains/subways for faster cross‑city travel and buses for direct temple access; book workshops (tea ceremony, kimono dressing, brewery tours) in advance. Respect local etiquette in geisha districts and food markets (no chasing/pressuring performers; avoid eating while walking in certain areas).

5‑day itinerary overview (high‑level)
Day 1 — Higashiyama & Nishiki Market
- Morning market crawl (Nishiki) → Kiyomizu‑dera and Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka → Gion stroll → dinner in Pontocho. Good intro to Kyoto’s streets, sweets and early kaiseki/izakaya.

Day 2 — Arashiyama & Sagano
- Early bamboo grove visit → Tenryu‑ji garden → yudofu lunch → optional scenic train/boat → riverside dinner or station‑area izakaya. A nature‑temple day with tofu specialties.

Day 3 — Northern temples & Philosopher’s Path
- Kinkaku‑ji → Ryoan‑ji → Philosopher’s Path to Ginkaku‑ji → afternoon tea/tea‑ceremony → evening kaiseki or cultural performance. Focus on gardens, contemplative walks, and matcha.

Day 4 — Fushimi (sake) and Uji (tea)
- Early Fushimi Inari → Fushimi brewery tours & tastings → train to Uji for Byodoin and matcha tastings → relaxed evening meal back in Kyoto. Dedicated sake + tea day trip.

Day 5 — Hands‑on culture, museums, and farewell dining
- Morning workshop (kimono dressing, ikebana, or calligraphy) → museum visit (Kyoto National Museum or Manga Museum) → Nishijin textiles or last shopping → special farewell dinner (another kaiseki or izakaya crawl). Wind down with cultural immersion and souvenir shopping.

Top practical tips (concise)
- Timing: beat crowds at Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama bamboo grove and Kiyomizu by going early; reserve kaiseki and workshops well ahead.
- Reservations: required for high‑end ryōtei and recommended for tea ceremonies, kimono sessions, and some brewery tours.
- Etiquette: respect geiko/maiko privacy; follow stall rules at markets; carry small bags for trash—public bins are limited.
- Transport: use trains/subways between districts; buses are useful for temple clusters but can be slower in traffic.
